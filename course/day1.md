# Welcome to the 5 Day Start Creating Robots course 

I'm John Vial, I've got a PhD in Robotics and currently work in Perth, Australia doing industrial robots. But don't worry, you won't need a PhD or to live in Australia to do this course. 

If you're like me, you've probably spent way too much time trying to figure out how to get started building robots with the Robotics Operating System (ROS). You've been tempted to install linux or try a VM but every guide quickly goes off the rails and you're left trying to debug some obscure error. As I went through this process I wished that there was an easier way. 

This course is my attempt at making an easy path for you.

# Who is this course for?

Not everyone is suitable for this course. Hopefully you:

- Are just getting started in robotics, and want to know if ROS is right for you. 
- Want to experiment with robotics. This course won't teach you fundamentals, rather its focus is getting you setup so you have a robotics test bed that could be shifted onto a real robot. 
- Have a Windows 11 computer. ROS runs best on Linux, but I'm assuming that you aren't yet ready to invest in a dual boot setup.

Each day I'll send you a quick email with the steps you'll need to follow to get it working. 

# Here is a quick overview of what we are going to do together:

Day 1 (Today) 
: Download Your Tools  All we are going to do today is just download windows tools. 

Day 2 
:  Setup your environment  We will setup a docker, VS Code dev container environment. It will end with a check that you have the Robotics simulation environment Gazebo working. 

Day 3 
: TeleoperationToday will be doing robot teleoperation, getting a feel for how the simulator works. 

Day 4 
:  Sensors & Mapping  Every robot needs sensors, and these sensors are used to make a map of the environment. 

Day 5 
: Autonomous Navigation  What everyone really wants is an autonomous robot. In the final day we will setup an autonomous robot system. 

# Todays Work
